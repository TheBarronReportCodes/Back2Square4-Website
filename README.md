##Task

Build a Python web app that displays clothing to the consumer to interact with and purchase.

##Criteria

##Summary of Tech Stack The main tech stacks used here are HTML5/CSS3/Bootstrap for the main design, Python for the core logic, using the MVT
standard, JSON from the initial data, and the Flask framework tool to help organize data and user authentication

##Functionality Using Python Flask that will fetch data from a JSON file to display prices of products to the consumer. A cart checkout system
using the JSON data that presents the subtotal to the customer before taking in their payment information. Payment is still in the works as
the client still needs to create a merchant account and I have yet to learn how to make a site SSL secure
